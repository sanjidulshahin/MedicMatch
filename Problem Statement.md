Problem Statement:

The cost of healthcare has been rising significantly over time in many nations, most notably the US, which has brought more focus to the
accessibility and openness of healthcare services. The lack of pricing transparency in the healthcare system is at the heart of this problem. It is
difficult for people to accurately evaluate costs and make decisions about their care since different hospitals, clinics, and healthcare providers
charge varying amounts for the same medical services.
